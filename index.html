    <h1>About D</h1>
    <p>
        Hi im D short for <strong>Da Lova</strong>, I love going for slow walks and giving hugs.
        I'm excited to be apart of the lovin movement. It makes me want to giggle with happiness.
        I chose to start lovin because a youtuber named Sensei McLovin.
        Sensei McLovin has shown me the way of enlovingment and sensitivity.
        My main goal in life is to spread lovin all around the globe and some day I would love to see the gates of Lovehalla.
